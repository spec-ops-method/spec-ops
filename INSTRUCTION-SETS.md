# SpecOps Instruction Set Examples
## Building a Collaborative Library of AI Agent Skills for Legacy Modernization

---

## Introduction

AI agent instruction sets—often called "skills" or "custom instructions"—are one of the most critical and reusable components of the SpecOps methodology. These instruction sets guide AI coding agents in understanding legacy code, generating accurate specifications, and implementing modern replacements.

**A key insight: Instruction sets are more portable and sharable than code.**

Unlike actual software code, which is tightly coupled to specific systems and contexts, instruction sets encode knowledge and patterns that can be applied across different organizations and projects. A well-crafted instruction set for understanding COBOL code works whether you're modernizing a benefits system in California or a tax system in New York.

This creates enormous opportunity for collaboration and knowledge sharing across government agencies, between states, and even internationally.

## The Evolving Nature of Instruction Sets

### Instruction Sets Are a Work in Progress

**Important**: When starting a SpecOps modernization project, you likely won't have all the instruction sets you need. This is normal and expected. Instruction sets will be:

- **Developed iteratively** as you learn what works
- **Refined continuously** based on AI agent performance
- **Created in parallel** with specification generation
- **Contributed from multiple sources** both inside and outside your core team
- **Shared and improved** across the SpecOps community

**You don't need perfect instruction sets to start.** Begin with basic instructions, learn from experience, and improve as you go.

### Parallel Development

Instruction set development can happen in parallel with other SpecOps phases:

**During Discovery**: Begin identifying needed instruction sets
**During Specification Generation**: Create and refine instructions as you encounter patterns
**Ongoing**: Continuously improve based on results
**Outside the Project**: Community members can contribute without being on the core team

This parallel approach means:
- Core team isn't blocked waiting for perfect instructions
- Domain experts can contribute instruction sets without technical expertise
- External contributors can help without access to legacy systems
- The instruction library grows organically over time

---

## Categories of Instruction Sets

SpecOps requires several types of instruction sets, each serving different purposes:

### 1. Legacy Code Comprehension Instructions

Help AI agents understand and document legacy systems:
- **COBOL Comprehension** - Understanding COBOL syntax, idioms, and patterns
- **Mainframe Environment** - JCL, CICS, batch processing, job scheduling
- **Legacy Databases** - VSAM, IMS, DB2 hierarchical structures
- **Legacy Application Servers** - CICS, WebSphere, Tuxedo
- **Procedural Language Skills** - PL/I, RPG, Natural, Assembly
- **Data Structure Analysis** - Copybooks, record layouts, file structures

### 2. Specification Generation Instructions

Guide AI in creating well-structured specifications:
- **Specification Structure** - Organizing specifications consistently
- **Plain Language Writing** - Making technical content accessible
- **Business Rule Extraction** - Separating logic from implementation
- **Edge Case Identification** - Recognizing and documenting exceptions
- **Cross-Reference Creation** - Linking related specifications
- **Uncertainty Documentation** - Flagging ambiguities for human review

### 3. Domain-Specific Instructions

Provide context for specific government domains:
- **Benefits Eligibility Rules** - SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc.
- **Tax Calculation Logic** - Income tax, sales tax, property tax
- **Licensing and Permitting** - Application workflows, approval processes
- **Financial Systems** - Accounting rules, budget controls, audit requirements
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Industry-specific regulations and standards

### 4. Modern Implementation Instructions

Guide generation of modern code from specifications:
- **Cloud-Native Patterns** - Microservices, serverless, containers
- **API Design** - RESTful patterns, GraphQL, async messaging
- **Database Modeling** - Relational design, NoSQL patterns
- **Security Implementation** - Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Testing Approach** - Test structure, coverage requirements

### 5. Government-Specific Instructions

Address unique government requirements:
- **Section 508 Compliance** - Accessibility requirements
- **FISMA/FedRAMP Security** - Security control implementation
- **Plain Language Act** - Clear communication requirements
- **ATO Documentation** - Security authorization artifacts
- **U.S. Web Design System** - Government UI standards
- **Open Data Standards** - DCAT-US, Project Open Data metadata

---

## Instruction Set Maturity Levels

Not all instruction sets need to be fully mature to be useful. We can think of them at different maturity levels:

### Level 1: Basic Instructions (Sufficient to Start)
- General guidance for the task
- Common patterns to look for
- Examples of desired output
- Known pitfalls to avoid

**Example**: "When analyzing COBOL code, identify PERFORM statements as function calls and MOVE statements as assignments."

### Level 2: Refined Instructions (Improved Through Use)
- Specific patterns for common scenarios
- Detailed examples from actual use
- Handling of edge cases
- Integration with other instruction sets

**Example**: "COBOL PERFORM statements with THRU clauses execute a range of paragraphs. Document these as compound operations in the specification..."

### Level 3: Mature Instructions (Battle-Tested and Comprehensive)
- Comprehensive pattern library
- Extensive examples and test cases
- Integration with multiple tools and workflows
- Community validation and contributions
- Version history and improvements documented

**Example**: Complete COBOL comprehension skill with hundreds of patterns, tested across dozens of systems, with contributions from multiple organizations.

**Start with Level 1, evolve to Level 3 through practice and community contribution.**

## Sharing Instruction Sets Across Governments

### Why This Works for Government

**Common Legacy Platforms**: Many governments use the same legacy technologies
- COBOL is COBOL everywhere
- Mainframe patterns are similar across organizations
- Database structures follow common patterns
- Business logic differs, but technical patterns don't

**Similar Domains**: Government functions are often parallel
- Benefits eligibility across states
- Tax systems across jurisdictions
- Licensing and permitting processes
- Financial management systems

**Shared Challenges**: Common problems create shared solutions
- Retiring workforce and knowledge loss
- Compliance and security requirements
- Budget constraints
- Need for modernization

**Low Barriers to Sharing**: Instruction sets are inherently shareable
- No proprietary business logic
- No sensitive data
- Just patterns and knowledge
- Easy to customize for local context

### What Can Be Shared

**Highly Shareable** (minimal customization needed):
- Legacy language comprehension (COBOL, RPG, etc.)
- Legacy platform knowledge (mainframes, databases)
- Specification structure and format
- Testing and validation patterns
- Security and compliance requirements
- Plain language and accessibility guidelines

**Moderately Shareable** (some customization needed):
- Domain-specific patterns (benefits, tax, licensing)
- Modern implementation patterns (may vary by tech choices)
- Organizational standards and conventions

**Less Shareable** (highly specific):
- Instructions tied to specific legacy system architecture
- Organization-specific business rules
- Custom integrations and dependencies

### Building a Shared Instruction Library

**Central Repository**:
- GitHub organization for government instruction sets
- Organized by category (language, platform, domain)
- Clear licensing (public domain or permissive open source)
- Quality standards and review process

**Contribution Process**:
- Template for new instruction sets
- Testing and validation requirements
- Documentation standards
- Community review and approval

**Maintenance and Evolution**:
- Version control for instruction improvements
- Feedback mechanisms for users
- Regular updates as AI tools evolve
- Attribution to contributors

**Discovery and Reuse**:
- Searchable catalog of available instructions
- Usage examples and test cases
- Success stories from adopters
- Metrics on instruction effectiveness

## Example Instruction Sets

Below are examples of instruction sets at different maturity levels. These are templates and starting points, not fully developed skills.

### Example 1: COBOL Business Logic Extraction (Level 2 - Refined)

```markdown
# COBOL Business Logic Extraction Skill

## Purpose
Help AI agents identify and extract business logic from COBOL code, separating it from technical implementation details.

## Key Patterns to Recognize

### Business Rules
- IF-THEN-ELSE statements implementing eligibility or calculation rules
- EVALUATE statements acting as decision tables
- COMPUTE statements performing calculations
- Nested conditionals implementing complex rule hierarchies

### Technical Implementation (Separate from Business Logic)
- File I/O operations (READ, WRITE, OPEN, CLOSE)
- Error handling routines
- Loop control structures (PERFORM UNTIL)
- Data movement without transformation (MOVE A TO B)

## Extraction Guidelines

### For Conditional Logic:
1. Identify the condition being tested
2. State it in plain language (e.g., "If applicant income is below threshold...")
3. Describe the action taken (e.g., "...then flag as eligible")
4. Note any exceptions or special cases
5. Cross-reference related business rules

### For Calculations:
1. Describe what is being calculated
2. List the inputs and their sources
3. Explain the formula in business terms
4. Note any constants or thresholds
5. Identify rounding or precision requirements

### For Decision Tables:
1. List all possible values being evaluated
2. Document the action for each value
3. Note the default case if present
4. Explain business meaning of each branch

## Output Format
Generate specifications that:
- Lead with business purpose
- Separate "what" from "how"
- Use domain language, not technical jargon
- Include examples for complex rules
- Flag ambiguities or uncertainties

## Examples

**Input (COBOL)**:
```cobol
IF INCOME-AMOUNT < POVERTY-THRESHOLD
   MOVE 'ELIGIBLE' TO DETERMINATION-CODE
   COMPUTE BENEFIT-AMT = BASE-BENEFIT * FAMILY-SIZE
ELSE
   MOVE 'NOT-ELIGIBLE' TO DETERMINATION-CODE
   MOVE ZERO TO BENEFIT-AMT
END-IF
```

**Output (Specification)**:
```
Business Rule: Income-Based Eligibility Determination

If applicant's household income is below the federal poverty threshold:
- Mark application as eligible
- Calculate benefit amount as: base benefit × family size

If applicant's household income is at or above poverty threshold:
- Mark application as not eligible
- Set benefit amount to zero

Inputs:
- Household income (annual dollar amount)
- Federal poverty threshold (annual dollar amount, varies by year)
- Family size (number of household members)
- Base benefit (dollar amount per person)

Outputs:
- Eligibility determination (eligible/not eligible)
- Benefit amount (monthly dollar amount or zero)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't reproduce technical syntax in specifications
- Don't assume you understand business purpose without evidence
- Don't skip edge cases even if code seems straightforward
- Don't merge multiple distinct rules into one specification section
- Flag uncertainty rather than guessing at business intent

## Integration Notes
- Works with COBOL Comprehension skill for syntax understanding
- Feeds into Specification Structure skill for organization
- Outputs used by Domain-Specific skills for validation
```

---

### Example 2: Benefits Eligibility Domain Skill (Level 1 - Basic)

```markdown
# Benefits Eligibility Domain Skill

## Purpose
Provide AI agents with context about public benefits eligibility determination to improve specification accuracy.

## Key Concepts

### Common Eligibility Factors
- Income (household, individual, gross, net)
- Assets (countable vs. excluded)
- Household composition (size, relationships)
- Residency requirements
- Citizenship/immigration status
- Work requirements
- Age requirements
- Disability status

### Typical Eligibility Rules
- Income thresholds (often as percentage of Federal Poverty Level)
- Asset limits
- Categorical eligibility (automatic qualification based on other program participation)
- Deductions and disregards (amounts excluded from income calculation)
- Special circumstances (hardship, emergency situations)

### Important Distinctions
- Application vs. recertification rules
- Initial vs. ongoing eligibility
- Mandatory vs. optional rules
- Federal minimum vs. state options

## Specification Guidance

When documenting eligibility rules:
1. Specify whether rule is federal requirement or state option
2. Include effective dates if rules have changed
3. Note any exceptions or special circumstances
3. Reference policy source (statute, regulation, manual) if possible
4. Include examples showing rule application
5. Flag complex interactions between rules

## Terminology Standards
- Use "applicant" before approval, "participant" or "beneficiary" after
- Use "household" not "family" unless specifically defined in policy
- Specify whether income is monthly, annual, or other period
- Be explicit about whose income/assets are counted
- Use "determination" or "decision" not "calculation" for eligibility

## Common Edge Cases to Watch For
- Self-employment income calculations
- Student status and income disregards
- Vehicle asset exclusions
- Treatment of lump sum payments
- Verification requirements and self-declaration

## Red Flags Requiring Domain Expert Review
- Unclear effective date for rule changes
- Ambiguous treatment of specific income or asset types
- Complex interactions between multiple eligibility factors
- Inconsistency between different parts of the code
- References to external systems or data sources
```

- Note dependencies explicitly
- Keep cross-references up to date

## Quality Checks

Before considering a specification complete:
- [ ] All required sections present (may be marked as "not applicable")
- [ ] Technical terms defined in glossary or explained
- [ ] Examples provided for complex logic
- [ ] Cross-references are accurate and working
- [ ] Verification status is current
- [ ] No placeholder text like "TBD" without explanation
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with other specifications

## Version Control

## Conclusion: Building Together

Instruction sets are the reusable knowledge layer that makes SpecOps practical at scale. Unlike proprietary code or sensitive data, instruction sets can and should be widely shared across government agencies and the broader community.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Start Simple**: Basic instructions are better than no instructions
2. **Iterate Quickly**: Refine based on real use, not speculation
3. **Share Openly**: Make instruction sets available to others
4. **Contribute Back**: Improve shared instructions with your learnings
5. **Build Together**: Collaboration multiplies the value for everyone

By building a shared library of instruction sets, the government technology community can:
- Reduce duplicated effort across agencies
- Accelerate adoption of SpecOps methodology
- Preserve knowledge about legacy systems
- Lower barriers to modernization
- Create a lasting resource for future projects

**The instruction sets you create today will help other agencies tomorrow. The instruction sets others create will help you today.**

This is how we build a sustainable approach to legacy modernization across government—not by each agency solving the same problems in isolation, but by sharing knowledge and building together.
