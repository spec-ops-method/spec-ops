# SpecOps: Specification-Driven Legacy System Modernization

> AI is going to change the game on legacy system modernization, but maybe not in the way you think.


## What is SpecOps?

SpecOps is a methodology for using AI to modernize legacy government systems by focusing on knowledge preservation and verified specifications rather than direct code translation.

Traditional AI-assisted modernization tries to transpile legacy code directly into modern languages. SpecOps uses AI to compile institutional knowledge into comprehensive, human-verified specifications that become the authoritative source of truth for system behavior.

**Bottom line**: The specification is more valuable than the code. It captures institutional knowledge, enables domain expert verification, and outlasts any particular technical implementation.

---

## Why SpecOps?

### The Problem with Direct Translation

When AI translates legacy software to modern software stacks automatically:
- ❌ Errors in understanding get embedded in new code
- ❌ Domain experts can't verify technical implementations
- ❌ Institutional knowledge remains locked in code
- ❌ No artifact exists if experts become available later

### The SpecOps Approach

When AI generates specifications first, then modern code:
- ✅ Domain experts verify specifications before any code is written
- ✅ Institutional knowledge is preserved in readable form
- ✅ Specifications outlast implementations and guide future changes
- ✅ Multiple stakeholders can review using natural language
- ✅ Changes flow through specifications with proper oversight

---

## Core Principles

1. **The Specification is the Source of Truth** - Like GitOps treats Git as authoritative for infrastructure, SpecOps treats specifications as authoritative for system behavior

2. **Knowledge Preservation Precedes Translation** - Capture and verify what the system does before building replacements

3. **Domain Experts Are the Arbiters** - Policy and business stakeholders verify specifications, not code

4. **AI Assists, Humans Verify** - AI excels at analysis and generation; humans excel at judgment and verification

5. **Changes Flow Through Specifications** - All modifications start with specification updates, reviewed and approved before implementation

6. **Specifications Should Be Accessible** - Readable by domain experts while detailed enough to guide implementation

**Key Insight**: The specification remains valuable forever. Updated code is just the current implementation.

## When to Use SpecOps

SpecOps is particularly effective when:

- ✅ Legacy system is poorly documented
- ✅ Institutional knowledge is at risk of being lost
- ✅ Business logic is complex and critical to get right
- ✅ Domain experts are available but can't verify code
- ✅ Long-term knowledge preservation is valuable
- ✅ Incremental modernization over years is expected
- ✅ System behavior must be auditable and explainable

SpecOps may not be necessary when:

- ⚠️ Legacy system is well-understood and well-documented
- ⚠️ Business logic is simple and stable
- ⚠️ Speed is prioritized over accuracy
- ⚠️ Comprehensive test coverage already exists

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Core Documents
- Start with the [Manifesto](MANIFESTO.md) to understand the philosophy
- Review the [Comparison Framework](COMPARISON.md) to see if SpecOps fits your context

### 2. Assess Your Situation
- Do you have domain experts available for verification?
- Is institutional knowledge at risk?
- Can you commit to incremental modernization?
- Do you have or can you acquire the necessary tools?

### 3. Start Small
- Select a pilot component (moderate complexity, known behavior)
- Prove the approach in your environment
- Refine tools and workflows
- Build team capability
- Demonstrate value to stakeholders

### 4. Scale Up
- Work through prioritized components incrementally
- Build library of specifications and instruction sets

## Community

SpecOps is designed to enable collaboration across government agencies and the civic tech community.

**Sharing Instruction Sets**: Technical patterns and AI instructions are highly portable across organizations. A COBOL comprehension skill works whether you're modernizing benefits in California or taxes in New York.

**Cross-Government Collaboration**: Many governments face identical legacy modernization challenges. Pooling resources and sharing instruction sets reduces duplicated effort.

**Open Source by Design**: All SpecOps documentation and instruction sets should be freely shareable to maximize reuse and adaptation.
